CSULB receives regional accreditation from WASC Senior College and University Commission. The site visit for the campus's most recent accreditation was October 21-23, 2020. The WSCUC Commission met on February 19, 2021 and granted CSULB the maximimum term for accreditation -- 10 years. The next site visit will be Fall 2030. Details about the Commission's decision can be found in the Commission Action Letter. Because of the high quality of its last accreditation results, CSULB was chosen as part of a select group of institutions to undergo Thematic Pathway for Reaffirmation. For more information regarding the 2020 accreditation process, please visit the page for Thematic Pathway Planning. Previous to its 2020 review, CSULB's last accreditation was a multi-stage, longitudinal process that required broad campus involvement. Over a five-year period, the university developed an institutional proposal, a capacity and preparatory review report, and an educational effectiveness review report. The site visit was conducted in Fall 2010 and the Commission Action Letter was received in February 2011. To review these materials, visit the CSULB WSCUC Archive. This website was created to serve as an electronic archive for the documents CSULB submitted to WSCUC as well as the accreditation-related documents received from WSCUC. In addition, many programs at CSULB received disciplinary accreditation. You can find the list of accredited programs here.
