You are considered a graduate applicant if you hold a bachelor's degree and wish to pursue a specific field of study that will lead to a master's degree or a doctoral degree. If you are interested in pursuing a teaching credential, other credential, certificate or second bachelor's degree, please visit those sections of the website for more information. What Graduate Programs Are Offered at CSU? Visit the Graduate Studies website and the University Catalog for information about the variety of Master's programs and Doctoral programs offered at CSU. Applicants must apply to a specific Master's degree or Doctoral degree program and meet the academic requirements of the program. If you wish to take classes for enrichment or to prepare for entry into a degree program, you can explore enrollment through the College of Professional and Continuing Education (CPaCE). How Do I Qualify for Graduate Admission? To qualify for admission to a Master’s or Doctoral program, you must meet the general university admission requirements for graduate standing as well as the professional, personal, scholastic and other standards as prescribed by the program. You can use the Graduate Studies site to link to information about these requirements as well as contact information for the various programs. The minimum university admission requirements for graduate standing consideration are: Complete a four-year college course of study and hold an acceptable baccalaureate degree from a regionally accredited institution by the end of the summer term prior to Fall enrollment or the end of the Fall semester for Spring enrollment. Be in good standing at the last college or university you attended. Meet the minimum GPA requirements for admission to the university. This can be met in any of the following ways: Hold an advanced degree Hold a baccalaureate degree with a cumulative GPA of at least 2.5. (No Rounding) Hold a baccalaureate degree with a GPA of at least 2.5 (No Rounding) in the last 60 semester or 90 quarter units you attempted, excluding lower-division and/or extension coursework attempted after the baccalaureate degree. Students in the process of completing a baccalaureate degree may be admitted on a provisional basis, subject to proof of degree completion, if their cumulative GPA is at least 2.7 (No Rounding) or if the GPA in their last 60 semester or 90 quarter units are calculated at a 2.5 (No Rounding) or higher. An official transcript showing degree completion must be submitted or the offer of admission will be withdrawn. True Cumulative GPA Calculation If transfer work is not included in GPA, we calculate the true cumulative GPA as follows: Use cumulative totals as they appear on the transcript from each school. Convert all units used into either semester or quarter units as follows: Multiply semester units by 1.5 = Quarter units Divide quarter units by 1.5 = Semester units Combine the units and grade points for all schools attended Divide total grade points by total units AA this will provide the true cumulative GPA (Total GP ÷ Total units = True Cumulative GPA) To Calculate a 60/90 GPA: Beginning with the most recent work, we calculate the grade points for the last 60 graded semester units (90-quarter units) completed. Use the whole term in your calculation. Do not use partial terms. Convert all units used into either semester or quarter units as follows: Multiply semester units by 1.5 = Quarter units Divide quarter units by 1.5 = Semester units Divide grade points by attempted units to get GPA. Please Note: We do not round GPA calculations.
