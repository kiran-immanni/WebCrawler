While we have no knowledge of any planned visit to our campus, we offer this website as a helpful resource. Background The university does not share information about immigration status, religion, nationality, ethnicity or other personal information about individual students or employees with anyone, including law enforcement authorities, without the student’s or employee’s permission, unless presented with a judicially issued warrant, court order, subpoena, or other legally binding requirement. Immigration enforcement is the responsibility of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, not the university. Consistent with the approach of law enforcement agencies in California, our University Police department does not inquire about immigration status in the normal course of its duties. This approach is codified in both California law and the CSU’s Policy 414. Social media Over the past couple of weeks, a number of social media posts suggested that federal officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement were on campus at various times. This is not known by the university to be true. Please remember that some social media posts are designed to deliberately misinform and misguide. Campus community members should take care to avoid spreading disinformation, even accidentally.
