We are making every effort to provide educational awareness tools to our campus community in an effort to support and empower our CSULB students and employees. For many, Affirmative Consent may be confusing. Our Beach IX Ally program asks our community partners to Refer student concerns to the appropriate support services and campus offices, Intervene where they see issues arising, Support those who may experiencing a Title IX related issue, and Educate themselves, students, and colleagues about Title IX, campus resources, and sexual misconduct prevention and awareness. To help educate our campus community understand CSU’s Affirmative Consent policy, please consider watching the following educational video: Consent - It's Simple as Tea. CSULB Consensual Relationship Policy The CSU prohibits employees from entering into a consensual relationship with any Student over whom they exercise direct or otherwise significant academic, administrative, supervisory, evaluative, counseling, or extracurricular authority. Please see the CSU Policy Prohibiting Discrimination, Harassment, Sexual Misconduct, Sexual Exploitation, Dating Violence, Domestic Violence, Stalking, and Retaliation (article VII, §A) and the CSULB Academic Senate policy for more information. Pregnancy and Parenting Resources Title IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex — including pregnancy, parenting and all related conditions — in education and in programs and activities that receive federal funding. All students who might be, are, or have been pregnant have a right to the same access to school programs and educational opportunities that other students have. If you would like to request accommodations as a pregnant or parenting student, contact the Bob Murphy Access Center (BMAC) as soon as possible. The university can require a pregnant student to provide a doctor’s certification of fitness to continue in an education program or activity only if the same requirement is imposed on all other students with physical or emotional conditions requiring a doctor’s care. Please submit medical or other medical information directly to the Bob Murphy Access Center (BMAC) – not to your professor. For privacy reasons, medical documentation is handled by the Bob Murphy Center. Lastly, per CSU’s Nondiscrimination Policy (or superseding), faculty and staff who are placed on notice by a student about the student’s pregnancy or pregnancy related restrictions are obligated to provide the Title IX Coordinator’s contact information, (Larisa Hamada | Email: Larisa.Hamada@csulb.edu | Phone: 562-985-8256). Additional Resources For student resources for pregnant and parenting students, contact the Women and Gender Equity Center (WGEC). CSULB Lactation Policy and Procedure for Students, Employees, and Third Parties Employees, students, and third parties have a right to request a lactation accommodation, including a private space reasonably close location to their working and learning environment. CSULB has designated permanent lactation spaces across campus, which provide a private space for the CSULB community. While these spaces may vary in the specific amenities, all spaces include access to a chair, table, a sink, and electrical outlets. If no permanent lactation space exists in a reasonably close location, individuals may request a temporary lactation space for the duration of their lactation needs. The University will make every effort to provide reasonable accommodations based on available space and resources and will provide a response to such requests, including written notice if a requested accommodation cannot be provided. Advance notification from the student, employee, or third party is strongly encouraged and we ask campus offices to assist in ensuring advance notice so a lactation space can be provided. Where refrigerators are not available in or reasonable near lactation spaces, individuals may request alternative cooling options as part of a lactation accommodation. All lactation accommodation requests, questions, or concerns should be submitted or referred to the Bob Murphy Access Center for review by contacting BMAC@csulb.edu or 562-985-5401 during the 8AM-5PM business hours. Additional lactation accommodation information, including a campus map, may be found on the Campus Website. An employee may report alleged violations of California Labor Code 1030-33 to the Office of Equity & Diversity or the Labor Commissioner’s field enforcement unit. A student may report alleged Title IX violations to the Office of Equity & Diversity or the Office of Civil Rights. A third party guest of the University may report alleged lactation concerns to the Office of Equity & Diversity or the Department of Fair Employment & Housing.
