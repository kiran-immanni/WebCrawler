Research proves that these foundational courses, if taken at the beginning of a studentâ€™s academic career, facilitates the ability for students to be successful during the transition to college-level academic work. In general, a combination of your high school math grades, high school grade point average, high school coursework history, and any applicable college coursework history will determine your placement in both Written Communication and Math courses.
