The Supplemental Application for Transfer is an online application that is specific to you, is specific to your intended major, and is specific to CSU Long Beach. You will be asked to review and confirm your academic record, including all colleges attended. You will also be asked to confirm your CSU eligibility and you will also be asked to report your progress towards completion of your Major Specific admission criteria. It is critical that the Supplemental Application is accurately completed and in its entirety. You are encouraged to review your academic records and to consult with counselors before you complete the Supplemental Application. Please note that, unlike the Cal State application, you will be given several weeks to complete the Supplemental Application, and you will have the opportunity to revisit your application and adjust your answers before the final deadline.
