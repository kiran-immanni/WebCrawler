The same geographic boundaries that have been historically used to determine local area high schools for freshmen remain in place and also apply to incoming transfers. Image Community Colleges and Local Preference Beginning Fall 2025, local area preference for transfer students will include applicants from select community colleges, provided they completed the majority of their units and their last school attended was one of these institutions. Image CSULB also grants local preference to: All military veterans, regardless of their school of origin All students from alternative high schools if the primary residence where they are educated is located within the current boundaries of CSULB’s local area Explore local area preference categories below: How Local Preference is Used for First-Time, First-Year (Freshman) Admission Applicants who are considered local based on their high school of graduation or military status who meet the CSULB minimum eligibility requirements but are not admissible to the major will be offered admission as an undeclared student. Undeclared students will explore other appropriate majors through coursework and advising and must meet the major-specific criteria for the major prior to declaring a major by their junior year. Applicants should note that undeclared is not a route to their initial intended major. Undeclared students work with university advisors to identify and succeed in alternate majors. How Local Preference is Used for Transfer Admission Transfer applicants to CSULB are considered local based on the high school from which they graduated, rather than the college they are transferring from. Or, if a student transfers with the majority of their units from one of the five local admission area community colleges and it is their last school of attendance, they are also considered local. Additionally, CSULB extends local preference to military veterans. For CSU-eligible applicants who are considered local, admission is guaranteed if they meet the major-specific minimum cumulative GPA and required lower-division preparation, except for highly impacted majors where this local preference does not apply.
