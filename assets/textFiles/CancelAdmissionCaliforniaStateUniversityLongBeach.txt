Explore the instructions below about how to cancel your admission to CSULB. Your request must be submitted before the first day of classes for the semester. After that date, you will not be eligible to cancel your admission and will instead need to follow the instructions for Dropping and Withdrawing. All cancellations of admission are final. Please be certain of this action before you submit your request. If you would like to attend CSULB in a future term, you will need to reapply for admission. Please note that the Admissions Cancellation form is for newly-admitted students only. If you are a current student (admitted to CSULB prior to Fall 2024), you may need to consider applying for an educational leave.
